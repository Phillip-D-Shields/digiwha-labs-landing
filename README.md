# 👾 Digiwha Labs
> ## Welcome to the Digiwha Labs ecosystem. 

This is a collection of hyper-focused, privacy-first Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) designed to optimize the "biological machine.

## "What is a Digiwha?
The name is a digital play on the Taniwha—powerful supernatural beings from Māori mythology. Taniwha are often protective guardians (kaitiaki) of specific places, or formidable creatures of the deep. Digiwha Labs acts as a digital guardian for your focus, health, and decision-making.
## 🚀 The Mission
In a world of bloated software and data-hungry platforms, Digiwha Labs builds tools that are:
- Simple: One page, one purpose.
- Private: No accounts, no servers. All data stays in your browser's LocalStorage.
- Slappable: Fully PWA-compliant. Install them to your home screen for instant, offline access.

## 🛠️ The Stack

This project is built with a "minimalist power" philosophy, using a modern, compiled stack to keep things lightning-fast:

| Technology | Role | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Svelte** | Framework | A "disappearing" framework that compiles to raw JS. No virtual DOM overhead. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Styling | Utility-first styling for precise control over the pixel-art aesthetic. |
| **daisyUI** | UI Library | Handles the component heavy-lifting while remaining fully themeable. |
| **LocalStorage** | Database | 100% client-side persistence. Your data never leaves your device. |
